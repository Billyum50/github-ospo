Thanks for helping make <COMPANY_NAME> projects safe for everyone.

## Security

<COMPANY_NAME> takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [<COMPANY_NAME>](https://github.com/<COMPANY_NAME>).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.
